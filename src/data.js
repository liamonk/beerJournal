      "I brewed this beer to have a refreshing hefeweizen on tap. I've made a few before but this time I tried to resist my urge to hop everything into oblivion. My OG came in a litte lower than I would have expected but still ended up with a respectable 4.2% ABV. Named because it is a German beer brewed in the pacific using ingredients from the pacific with pacifica hops!",

      "A dark beer is a great thing and with a bit more hoppyness you get an American Porter. I've always liked this style and was aiming for a low ABV porter with plenty of body and a but of hoppyness to go with it. ",

      "A tasty beer with a decent amount of roast and nice hoppy notes. Came out reasonably low ABV but still tastes really full. Ideal winter sipper, would brew again.",

      "I brewed this beer with my mum because she came to visit and I wanted us to make something she would enjoy on her next visit. It was made with all NZ ingredients and was meant to be hoppy and refreshing. The idea was I could take a bottle to Auckland with me at Queens Birthday for a tasting session (which went down nicely!). It is the second beer in my family series following on from the Irish Red I brewed with my dad.",

      "A tasty and refreshing beer with a bit of malt sweetness and a plesant hoppy aroma and flavour. Something for everyone in this beer. Would brew again!",

      "A cold IPA is pretty much the same thing as an IPL but a bit drier. I always liked a hoppy lager so was keen to give a beer like this a try. I used glucoamalyse enzyme to help dry the beer out and a lot of whirlpool / dry hops. I have no idea why it is called a cold IPA but it was a fun beer to try and brew.",
    review:
      "Nice and hoppy with a surprising amount of malt sweetness for how dry the beer came out. Has kept well and is nice and crystal clear. Doesn't seem as high alcohol as it is and turned out to be pretty refreshing.",

      "I love a dark beer and wanted to brew something a bit different. I decided on a dark saison and originally planned to add 100g dried cranberries. In the end I chickened out and didn't add the cranberries because I was worried the flavour of them would be a bit much and I was worried about the potential for contamination of my equipment.",
    review:
      "This was a yummy beer but there was a bit too much bitterness for such a dry beer. I also think I should have cut back on the roasted malt because it was a little astringent. Next time I'd definately add the cranberries too. Nice beer overall",
