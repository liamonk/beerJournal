        description: "I brewed this beer to have a refreshing hefeweizen on tap. I've made a few before but this time I tried to resist my urge to hop everything into oblivion. My OG came in a litte lower than I would have expected but still ended up with a respectable 4.2% ABV. Named because it is a German beer brewed in the pacific using ingredients from the pacific with pacifica hops!",

    description: "I brewed this beer with my mum because she came to visit and I wanted to make something she would enjoy. It was made with all NZ ingredients and was meant to be hoppy and refreshing. The idea was I could take a bottle to Auckland with me at Queens Birthday for a tasting session. It is the second beer in my family series following on from the Irish Red I brewed with my dad.",
    review:"A tasty and refreshing beer with a bit of malt sweetness and a plesant hoppy aroma and flavour. Something for everyone in this beer. Would brew again!",

    description: "I love a dark beer and wanted to brew something a bit different. I decided on a dark saison and originally planned to add 100g dried cranberries. In the end I chickened out and didn't add the cranberries because I was worried the flavour of them would be a bit much and I was worried about the potential for contamination of my equipment.",
    review:"This was a yummy beer but there was a bit too much bitterness for such a dry beer. I also think I should have cut back on the roasted malt because it was a little astringent. Next time I'd definately add the cranberries too. Nice beer overall",
